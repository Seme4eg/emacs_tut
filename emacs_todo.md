does `set filetype={file_type}` works in emacs?

`set tabstop=2` - works as well in emacs?

how to set autoformatting in emacs, like VIM's `set formatoptions=...`?

emacs_set.org --> environment --> not used --> (require 'cl) --> the hell is that?

In Emacs 24.4, `electric-pair-mode` minor-mode is much improved and
actually `supersedes autopair` in functionality and general all-around
Emacs integration, and I recommend you use it instead.

> find a way to enable it in all code files

turn on line wrapping in all buffers

install some extension for syntax highlighting in .gitignore files
