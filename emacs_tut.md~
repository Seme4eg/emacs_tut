C-x == ctrl-x | M-x == alt-x

C-v	Move forward one screenful
M-v	Move backward one screenful
C-l Clear screen and redisplay all the text, moving the text around the
    cursor to the center of the screen. (like `zz` in vim)

C-x 1 -- One window (i.e., kill all other windows).

    C-p
C-b     C-f
    C-n

C-x -- undo

C-x C-f -- find/create a file and also switch between buffers

> bottom line is called minibuffer

C-x C-s -- save the file

C-x C-b -- List buffers

C-x b {buffer-name} - switch to buffer {buffer_name}

C-x C-c -- Quit Emacs

C-z -- exit Emacs *temporarily*--so that you can go
back to the same Emacs session afterward

C-x s - Save some buffers

C-x u - Undo

C-s -- forward search

C-r -- reverse search.


## Extending the command set

C-x	Character extend.  Followed by one character.
M-x	Named command extend.  Followed by a long name.



* AUTO SAVE
-----------

Emacs periodically writes an "auto save" file for each file that
you are editing. The auto save file name looks like "#{file_name}#". 
When you save the file, Emacs deletes its auto save file.

If the computer crashes, you can recover it by opening it again and then typing
M-x recover file RET

---

If you are going to be editing human-language text, such as this file, you
should probably use Text Mode.

>> Type M-x text mode<Return>.

M-f and M-b now treat apostrophes as part of words. In Fundamental mode, M-f
and M-b treated apostrophes as word-separators.

Major modes usually make subtle changes like that one: most commands
do "the same job" in each major mode, but they work a little bit
differently.

To view documentation on your current major mode, type C-h m.

Major modes are called major because there are also minor modes.
Minor modes are not alternatives to the major modes, just minor
modifications of them.  Each minor mode can be turned on or off by
itself, independent of all other minor modes, and independent of your
major mode.  So you can use no minor modes, or one minor mode, or any
combination of several minor modes.

When in Auto Fill mode, Emacs breaks the line in between words automatically
whenever you insert text and make a line that is too wide.

toggle: `M-x auto fill mode<Return>`

Default margin is 70 chars, but you can change it: `C-x f {number}`

M-q -- re-fill the paragraph under cursor

---

C-x 2 -- split the screen into two windows

C-M-v -- sctoll to the bottom window

`C-x o` -- (o for 'other') to move the cursor to the bottom window

`C-x 4 C-f {file_name}` -- See the specified file appear in the bottom
window. The cursor goes there, too.


* RECURSIVE EDITING LEVELS
--------------------------

Sometimes you will get into what is called a "recursive editing
level".  This is indicated by square brackets in the mode line,
surrounding the parentheses around the major mode name.  For
example, you might see [(Fundamental)] instead of (Fundamental).

To get out of the recursive editing level, type <ESC> <ESC> <ESC>.
That is an all-purpose "get out" command.  You can also use it for
eliminating extra windows, and getting out of the minibuffer.

>> Type M-x to get into a minibuffer; then type <ESC> <ESC> <ESC> to
   get out.

You cannot use C-g to get out of a recursive editing level.  This is
because C-g is used for canceling commands and arguments WITHIN the
recursive editing level.
